# Haml Contrib

This project contains various useful extensions to the Haml template language's
Ruby implementation. Such extensions are useful enough to be distributed, but
not widely used or on-topic enough to belong in Haml proper.

This gives the Haml project a reasonable way to both demote current
functionality, such as the Textile and Maruku filters, and add new experimental
functionality that may later be added to the core.

At the moment this is *not* on Rubygems, since it is meant to work with Haml
3.2, which has not been released yet.
